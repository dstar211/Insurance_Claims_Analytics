# 🚗 Case Study: Mitigating Risk in Auto Insurance Claims
> **Objective:** Analyzing $187.8M in total claims to identify high-risk demographics and optimize policy pricing strategies.

## 🔍 The Business Challenge
The insurance firm was managing a massive portfolio of **37,542 policies**, but lacked a granular understanding of what was driving the **$187.8M in total claim costs**. Leadership needed to know:
* Which **Car Makes** were most expensive to insure?
* How do **Education levels** and **Marital status** correlate with claim frequency?
* Are **Urban or Rural** zones driving higher financial losses?

I developed a centralized intelligence hub to track four critical KPIs:
1.  **Total Claim Amount:** $187.8M.
2.  **Average Claim Frequency:** 0.51.
3.  **Average Claim Value:** $5.0K.
4.  **Gender Distribution:** Nearly equal split between Male (18.7K) and Female (18.8K) policyholders.

## 💡 Key Data Storytelling Insights

### 🏢 The Urban-Rural Divide
* **Insight:** Claims are almost perfectly split between **Urban (20.35%)** and **Rural (19.94%)** zones, each accounting for roughly **$37M–$38M** in losses.
* **Strategic Action:** Pricing models do not need to vary significantly by zone, as the risk is distributed evenly across geographic boundaries.

### 🏎️ Vehicle Risk Profiles
* **Highest Risk:** **Ford ($17M)** and **Chevrolet ($15M)** represent the highest total claim amounts.
* **Private vs. Commercial:** Private car use accounts for a staggering **$150.4M** in claims compared to only **$37.4M** for commercial use.

### 🎓 Socio-Economic Correlation
* **The "Education" Factor:** Policyholders with **High School** education levels represent the highest segment of claims at **$51.8M**.
* **Marital Status:** Single individuals with Bachelor’s degrees drive the highest single-segment claim cost at **$38.7M**.

## 🚀 Business Impact & Recommendations
Based on these findings, I proposed the following data-driven strategies:
1.  **Adjust Premiums for High-Risk Makes:** Increase premiums for Ford and Chevrolet models to offset their higher claim volumes.
2.  **Targeted Marketing:** Focus acquisition efforts on **Masters/PhD holders**, as they show significantly lower claim amounts ($28.3M and $11.9M respectively) compared to other education brackets.
3.  **Risk Refinement:** Re-evaluate the "Single" demographic pricing, as they consistently lead in claim amounts across most education levels.
